# Classification of wine types using PCA and non-neural classification methods
There is the question of classifying the types of wines into three categories based on their 13 defining characteristics. The Wine data set made available contains 178 labeled samples, each one being assigned the variety (class) of wine from which it comes. With the help of this information, it is proposed to use the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm in order to extract the significant features of the wines and to classify the wines with a non-neural classification algorithm. The proposed non-neural classification methods are as follows: Nearest Neighbor, 3-Nearest Neighbor, Nearest Prototype (Supervised K-Means). By using these methods, the aim is to achieve the best results in the determination of the wine variety at a minimum cost of computational resources. The final results will be compared between the three proposed classifiers.
